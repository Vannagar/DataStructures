This was made by a student (Nihal Shivannagari) so take everything with a grain of salt. Although all the code has been tested, there may still be errors and 
bugs that need to be fixed please let me know if you find any. If you come across an issue during a competitive programming contest, you may customize the 
code independently and let me know later. I will try to get the issue fixed as soon as possible. Most of the classes are made with integers in mind. If this 
is an issue or you want to see a more broad variety of variables that can be housed, please let me know and I will try to expand the options available.
